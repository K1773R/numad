# numad for debian/ubuntu

Numad is a system daemon that monitors NUMA topology and resource usage. It will attempt to locate processes for efficient NUMA  locality and  affinity,  dynamically  adjusting  to  changing system conditions. Numad also provides guidance to  assist  management  applications  with initial manual binding of CPU and memory resources for their processes. Note that numad is primarily intended for server consolidation environments,  where  there might be multiple applications or multiple virtual guests running on the same server system.  Numad is most likely to have a  positive  effect  when processes can be localized in a subset of the system's NUMA nodes.  If the entire system is dedicated to a large  inmemory  database  application,  for  example  --  especially  if memory accesses will likely remain unpredictable -- numad  will  probably  not improve performance.
